I have nothing to hide.”多年来，我们在DuckDuckGo经常听到一种对网络隐私有缺陷的反驳:“我为什么要在意?我没有什么好隐瞒的。”As Internet privacy has become more mainstream, this argument is rightfully fading away. However, it’s still floating around and so we wanted to take a moment to explain three key reasons why it's flawed.随着互联网隐私越来越受到关注，这一观点正逐渐消失。然而，它仍然在四处飘荡，所以我们想花点时间来解释它存在缺陷的三个主要原因。1) Privacy isn’t about hiding information; privacy is about protecting information, and surely you have information that you’d like to protect.隐私不是隐藏信息，而是保护信息，你肯定有你想保护的信息。Do you close the door when you go to the bathroom? Would you give your bank account information to anyone? Do you want all your search and browsing history made public? Of course not.你上厕所时会关上门吗?你会把你的银行账户信息告诉任何人吗?你想让你所有的搜索和浏览记录都公开吗?当然不是。Simply put, everyone wants to keep certain things private and you can easily illustrate that by asking people to let you make all their emails, texts, searches, financial information, medical information, etc. public. Very few people will say yes.简单地说，每个人都想保留一些隐私，你可以通过让人们把他们所有的电子邮件、短信、搜索、财务信息、医疗信息等都公开化来简单地说明这一点。很少有人会同意。2) Privacy is a fundamental right and you don't need to prove the necessity of fundamental rights to anyone.隐私是一项基本权利，你不需要向任何人证明基本权利的必要性。You should have the right to free speech even if you feel you have nothing important to say right now. You should have the right to assemble even if you feel you have nothing to protest right now. These should be fundamental rights just like the right to privacy.你应该有言论自由的权利，即使你现在没有什么重要的事情要说。即使你现在没有什么可以抗议的，你也应该有集会的权利。这些应该是基本权利，就像隐私权一样。And for good reason. Think of commonplace scenarios in which privacy is crucial and desirable like intimate conversations, medical procedures, and voting. We change our behavior when we're being watched, which is made obvious when voting; hence, an argument can be made that privacy in voting underpins democracy.而且理由很充分。想想一些常见的场景，在这些场景中，隐私是至关重要的，也是人们想要的，比如亲密对话、医疗程序和投票。当我们被监视时，我们会改变自己的行为，这在投票时表现得很明显;因此，有一种观点认为，投票中的隐私是民主的基础。3) Lack of privacy creates significant harms that everyone wants to avoid.  缺乏隐私会造成严重伤害。You need privacy to avoid unfortunately common threats like identity theft, manipulation through ads, discrimination based on your personal information, harassment, the filter bubble, and many other real harms that arise from invasions of privacy.你需要隐私以避免不幸的常见风险，如身份信息被盗、通过广告操纵你、基于个人信息的歧视、骚扰、过滤气泡，以及侵犯隐私带来的许多其他实际伤害。In addition, what many people don’t realize is that several small pieces of your personal data can be put together to reveal much more about you than you would think is possible. For example, an analysis conducted by MIT researchers found that “just four fairly vague pieces of information — the dates and locations of four purchases — are enough to identify 90 percent of the people in a data set recording three months of credit-card transactions by 1.1 million users.”此外，许多人没有意识到的是，你的几个小的个人数据可以组合在一起，透露的信息要比你想象的多得多。例如，麻省理工学院的研究人员进行的一项分析发现，“根据110万用户3个月信用卡的交易记录，只要4条相当模糊的信息，4条购物的数据及地点，就足够在一个数据库中识别出90%的人。”It’s critical to remember that privacy isn't just about protecting a single and seemingly insignificant piece of personal data, which is often what people think about when they say, “I have nothing to hide.” For example, some may say they don't mind if a company knows their email address while others might say they don't care if a company knows where they shop online.重要的是要记住，隐私不仅仅是保护一个看似无关紧要的个人数据。当人们说“我没有什么好隐瞒的”时，他们往往会这样想。例如，一些人可能会说他们不介意公司知道他们的电子邮件地址，而另一些人可能会说他们不介意公司知道他们在哪里网上购物。However, these small pieces of personal data are increasingly aggregated by advertising platforms like Google and Facebook to form a more complete picture of who you are, what you do, where you go, and with whom you spend time. And those large data profiles can then lead much more easily to significant privacy harms. If that feels creepy, it’s because it is.然而，像谷歌和Facebook这样的广告平台越来越多地收集这些小块的个人数据，以便更全面地了解你是谁、你在做什么、你去哪里、你和谁在一起。而这些大型数据档案则更容易导致严重的隐私损害。如果这让人觉得毛骨悚然，那是因为确实如此。We can't stress enough that your privacy shouldn’t be taken for granted. The ‘I have nothing to hide’ response does just that, implying that government and corporate surveillance should be acceptable as the default.我们再怎么强调也不为过，你的隐私不应该被毫无理由地暴露出来。“我没有什么好隐瞒的”就是对这种想法的回应，这意味着政府和企业的监控应该作为默认情况被接受。Privacy should be the default. We are setting a new standard of trust online and believe getting the privacy you want online should be as easy as closing the blinds.隐私应该是默认的。我们正在建立一个新的在线信任标准，相信在网上获得你想要的隐私应该像关上百叶窗一样容易。For more privacy advice, follow us on Twitter & get our privacy crash course.如果您需要更多的隐私建议，请关注我们的推特和获取我们的隐私速成课程。Dax the duckWe are the Internet privacy company that lets you take control of your information, without any tradeoffs.
