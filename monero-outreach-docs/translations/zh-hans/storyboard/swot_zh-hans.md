Translated from https://www.monerooutreach.org/stories/monero_swot_analysis.phpAn In-Depth SWOT Analysis of Monero门罗币的深入SWOT分析An in-depth look at Monero’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.深入了解门罗币的优势、劣势、机会和威胁。Monero has been in development since 2014. It utilizes the CryptoNote protocol, which was created in response to the inherent weaknesses of Bitcoin. Here we take a look at the Monero project to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT).门罗币始发于2014年。它利用了CryptoNote协议，该协议是针对比特币固有的弱点而创建的。现在我们来看看门罗币项目，以确定它的优势、劣势、机会和威胁(SWOT)。Strengths 优势Strong development. Third highest code contributor count (547+ all time developers), led only by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Utilizes bug bounties. Has been attacked multiple times, making it stronger each time. Sound and battle tested CryptoNote codebase. 强劲的发展。门罗币始的代码贡献者数量(547多个开发人员)位居第三高，仅次于比特币和以太坊。利用漏洞设计奖赏。门罗币被攻击过多次，每次都让它变得更强大。试探与攻击测试着CryptoNote代码库。Privacy. Obfuscating every layer of the transaction (sender, receiver, and amount), Monero seeks to find the right balance between absolute privacy and usability.隐私。混淆转账的每一步(发送方、接收方和金额)，门罗币寻求在绝对隐私和可用性之间找到恰当的平衡点。Highly researched and peer-review focused. Uses proven encryption protocols to maintain privacy for the network and its users. Also has its own independent Monero Research Lab which sends new developments through formal third party auditing before implementing into Monero code.注重调查研究和同行互查。使用经过验证的加密协议来维护网络及其用户的隐私。也有自己的独立的门罗币研究实验室，它在正式启用门罗币代码之前，会先将新的发展计划发给正式的第三方，并通过其审计。Active community. 23 repositories in the Monero Ecosystem. 340 repositories on the Monero topic. 200+ active contributors to the Monero code. Workgroups ranging from general community organization, research, translations/localization, outreach, hardware wallets, and event planning. Fixes problems quickly and effectively establishes consensus on important decisions.活跃的社区。门罗币生态系统中有23个代码库。门罗币主题上有340个代码库。社区中也有200多个活跃的门罗币代码贡献者。工作组包括一般社区组织、研究、翻译/本地化、扩展推广、硬件钱包和活动规划。快速地解决问题，有效地就重要决策达成共识。Fixed supply and stable emission curve schedule of 0.3 XMR per minute, so a rise in demand could see appreciation for the long term and it incentivizes miners to secure the network indefinitely. Is a great alternative to blockchains that will depend on fees to secure their network longterm. Also creates stable, predictable inflation which supports good economics.固定的供应量和每分钟0.3个门罗币的稳定排放曲线，因此长期而言，需求的增长可能会带来升值，这将激励矿工无限期地确保网络的安全。所以对于那些依赖收费来确保其网络的长期安全的区块链来说，门罗币是一个很好的替代品。也创造了稳定的，可预测的通货膨胀，这样就支撑起了良好的经济。ASIC resistant proof of work consensus algorithms acknowledge the centralization issues inherent in a small group of companies manufacturing most of the world’s ASICs. The Monero community has established consensus to resist ASIC mining until ASICs are commoditized and accessibility problems improve. This currently makes mining Monero something that is accessible to anyone with a CPU.抵抗ASIC工作量证明共识算法承认：中心化问题源自于一小群公司制造了世界上大部分的ASIC。门罗币社区已经达成共识，将抵抗ASIC挖矿直到ASIC商品化，并容易被大众获得。所以目前只要有CPU的人就能进行门罗币挖矿。Great communication with exchanges, wallet providers, community, investors, miners and the public via Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, and their mailing list. Communicating network upgrade requirements and critical updates and notices. Additionally, they provide full logs of development meetings going back as far as 2016.通过Reddit、Twitter、GitHub和他们的邮件列表，与交易所、钱包供应商、社区、投资者、矿工和公众进行良好的沟通。沟通网络升级的需求、关键更新及通知。此外，他们提供了追溯到2016年的开发会议的完整日志。Usability. Desktop GUI wallets are available and relatively easy to use for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. User friendly mobile wallets are available on Android and iOS. Hardware wallet support on the popular Ledger and Trezor wallets. Monero community has also funded development of an open-source hardware wallet.可用性。桌面GUI钱包是可用的，并且对于Windows、MacOS和Linux相对容易使用。用户友好的移动钱包可以在Android和iOS上使用。硬件钱包支持Ledger和Trezor钱包。门罗币社区还资助了开源硬件钱包的开发。Governance of the Monero project is decentralized The core developers are all individuals spread throughout the globe, rather than being part of a single entity. They communicate transparently and attempt to find consensus among the community before major decisions are made. So far they have not abused their powers and have not given any reason to believe they would. Critics have argued it’s not decentralized enough, but compared to other major cryptocurrencies it is among the best.门罗币项目的治理是去中心化的，核心开发人员都是遍布全球的个人，而不是作为单个实体的一部分。他们进行透明的沟通，并试图在做出重大决定之前在社区中找到共识。到目前为止，他们还没有滥用权力，也没任何理由相信他们会滥用权力。批评家认为，比特币的去中心化程度不够，但与其他主要加密货币相比，比特币是最好的加密货币之一。Auditable by choice. Unlike Bitcoin that has a transparent blockchain and can be audited by anyone at anytime, Monero can be audited only by choosing to share its private view keys, allowing auditors to confirm an individual’s amount of Monero and giving individuals and businesses the power to control when they choose to share their private financial information.Accessible and acceptable through dozens of exchanges and a number of payment gateways. Accepted by a long and respectable list of merchants. See official website and Project Coral Reef for examples.可选性的审计。不像比特币拥有一个透明的区块链，并且可以任何时候任何人都能审计。门罗币只有选择共享查阅密钥才能被审计。当他们选择共享他们的私人财务信息时，就允许审计员确认个人门罗币数量及给个人和企业控制权。你可以通过数十个交易所和多个支付网关访问和接受门罗币。门罗币已被很多可敬的商人所接受。参见官方网站和Coral Reef项目。Public. The lead maintainer, Riccardo Spagni, is not afraid to show his face in public. This is also true of many of the most active community members.公众。主要维护者里卡多·斯帕尼(Riccardo Spagni)并不害怕在公共场合露面。这也适用于许多最活跃的社区成员。Business Oriented. Many developers and community members have built and are building businesses around Monero to enhance the ecosystem.以业务导向。许多开发人员和社区成员已经建立并正在围绕门罗币建立业务，以增强生态系统。Scalable. Dynamic block size limit depending on network demand allows for automatic scalability.可拓展性。动态区块大小限制取决于网络需求，允许自动拓展。Decentralized and Global. The Monero community and its developers are made of individuals from around the planet and has an incredibly active Localization/Translation system that produces Monero content and services for a wide range of languages around the world.去中心化和全球化。门罗币社区及其开发人员由来自世界各地的个人组成，他们拥有一个非常活跃的本地化/翻译系统，为世界各地的人提供各种语言的门罗币内容和服务。Future Oriented. Monero’s community has donated to fund development of decentralized network-traffic hiding tools that will allow users to hide their location and IP address. The Monero Transmissions Lab also aims to brainstorm solutions for future off-grid or off-main-net Monero transactions, using open-sourced protocols and infrastructure for satellite and mobile ad hoc mesh communications.面向未来的。门罗币的社区已经筹款成立基金，开发去中心化网络流量隐藏工具，这样用户就可以隐藏他们的位置和IP地址。门罗币传输实验室还旨在使用开源协议和用于卫星和移动网络通信的基础设施，为未来的离线门罗币交易集思广议解决方案。Savvy and Dedicated Community. Monero’s online community is known for its no-frills attitude and has consistently demonstrated the depth and breadth of its knowledge-base by contributing to online forums, research, lectures, and other cryptocurrency related developments.精明而专注的社区。门罗币的在线社区以其朴实无为的态度而闻名，并通过为在线论坛、研究、讲座和其他与加密货币相关的开发做出贡献，不断展示其知识库的深度和广度。Funding Model. The large number of donors is evidence that a systemic funding channel like a mining tax or premine was never essential for Monero’s technical progress. However, some critics also view the funding model as a weakness. See below.融资模式。大量捐助者证明，门罗币不必采用像矿税或预挖这样的系统性融资。然而，一些批评人士也认为，这种融资模式存在弱点。见下文。Talent Magnet. Monero has attracted several talented individuals who contribute to its code and ecosystem. A notable example is Howard Chu, Founder and Chief Architect of Symas Corp. and former technician and consultant of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who supported Shuttle missions as a lead software engineer.人才吸引。门罗币吸引了几位优秀的人才，他们为门罗币代码和生态系统做出了贡献。例如Howard Chu, Symas公司的创始人和首席架构师，美国宇航局喷气推进实验室的前技术人员和顾问，他曾经作为首席软件工程师支持航天飞机的任务。Weaknesses 弱点Liquidity. Due to the relative complexity of Monero’s code (compared to Bitcoin or ERC20 based cryptocurrencies) it is more challenging to integrate Monero on cryptocurrency exchanges, services, and markets, thus making liquidity a bigger challenge.流动性。由于门罗币的代码相对复杂(与比特币或基于ERC20的加密货币相比)，在加密货币交易所、服务和市场上整合门罗币更具挑战性，从而使流动性面临更大的挑战。 Semi-annual Network Upgrades (Hard forks). While currently a strength because it patches bugs and enhances the performance, efficiency, and usability of Monero, it is not a good long-term strategy. It also has the potential to introduce new bugs each time it occurs. Creates more opportunities for scam forks to arise, which can create confusion and decrease network privacy if users share secret keys with forked coins.半年一次的网络升级(硬分叉)。虽然目前它的优势在于修补了漏洞并提高了门罗币的性能、效率和可用性，但这不是一个好的长期策略。它还可能在每次升级时引入新的漏洞。这就为诈骗分支的出现创造了更多的机会，如果用户与分叉的币共享密钥，就会造成混淆并降低网络隐私性。Scalability. Monero solves the fungibility and privacy issues of bitcoin at the expense of additional technical complexity through privacy layers. It also means the scaling issues of bitcoin are magnified to some extent with Monero. Monero’s dynamic blocksize helps, but these other issues must be addressed.可扩展性。门罗币通过增加隐私层技术复杂性为代价，解决了比特币无法解决的可互换性和隐私问题。这也意味着比特币的规模问题在一定程度上被门罗币放大了。虽然门罗币的动态块大小对此问题有所帮助，但必须彻底解决其他问题。Slightly centralized development team and social media channels that so far has been benevolent, but does make some people concerned about centralization.稍微集中化的开发团队和社交媒体渠道到目前为止一直是有益的，但确实让一些人担心中心化。Community Discussion is found primarily on IRC, Reddit, and GitHub. For some critics, this is not decentralized enough.社区讨论首先可以在聊天软件、Reddit和GitHub上找。对一些批评人士来说，这还不够去中心化。Complex and highly technical. While this is not a weakness in and of itself, the encryption protocols, hashing algorithms, and various features like Payment ID, Subaddresses, Ring CT, and others can create confusion and uncertainty among less technical users and community members. It has also shown to be a barrier to adoption because it creates challenges for exchanges, merchants, and others to integrate Monero into their ecosystems.技术含量高且复杂。虽然这本身并不是一个弱点，但是加密协议、哈希算法以及诸如支付ID、子地址、环形加密交易等各种特性可能会在技术水平较低的用户和社区成员之间造成混淆和不确定性。它也被证明是使用的一个障碍，因为它为交易所、商人和其他将门罗币融入他们生态系统的人带来了挑战。Large blockchain size which must be synced to show balance and transact with wallets. Steps are being taken to mitigate this, but it is still a challenge for easy usability and scalability. However, seven eighths of prunable blockchain data will soon be pruned.大的区块链尺寸，必须同步显示平衡和钱包转账。目前正在采取措施来缓解这种情况，但对于易用性和扩展性来说，这仍然是一个挑战。因此，八分之七的可删减的区块链数据将很快被删除。Funding Model is based on donations. Potential donors are incentivized to “free ride”, and see if someone else will donate instead. It also makes it hard to raise funds for other important things like quality control, customer support, and documentation. This puts pressure on those who own a lot of Monero and can lead to slower development in general.资助模式是建立在捐赠的基础上的。潜在的捐赠者会被鼓励“搭便车”，看看其他人是否愿意捐赠。这也使得很难为其他重要的事情筹集资金，如品控、客户支持和文献记录。这给那些拥有大量门罗币的人带来了压力，并可能导致总体发展放缓。The code and especially APIs could be cleaner for developers to help improve adoption and integration with business and services.对于开发人员来说，代码，尤其是程序界面可以更干净，从而帮助改进采用和整合商业及服务。Network privacy threats. There are a variety of theoretical attacks to the network’s privacy that could occur. See threats for more details.网络隐私的风险。理论上，网络隐私可能会受到各种各样的攻击。请参见更多风险详情。Transaction size. The enhanced privacy layers of Monero make for a larger transaction size than bitcoin. Bulletproofs made a significant improvement for Monero transactions, but more needs to be done to ensure scalability to and beyond the level of daily bitcoin transactions.交易尺寸。门罗币增强隐私层使得交易尺寸大于比特币。防弹证明对门罗币的交易进行了重大改进，但还需要做更多的工作，以确保可扩展性达到或超过日常比特币交易的水平。Opportunities 机会Market Cap. Monero has the opportunity to remain the highest-ranked privacy-based cryptocurrency.市值。门罗币有机会继续保持排名最高的基于隐私的加密货币。Bitcoin hedge. As the inherent issues with Bitcoin and its lack of privacy at the protocol level become more realized by the public, Monero has an opportunity to significantly increase by market cap as well as adoption and liquidity.比特币对冲。随着公众越来越意识到比特币的固有问题及其在协议层面缺乏隐私，门罗币的市值、采用率和流动性将有机会大幅增长。Global markets. Monero could become listed on more global markets and thus increase liquidity.全球市场。门罗币可以在更多的全球市场上市，从而增加流动性。Regulated exchanges. If technical challenges are overcome, Monero could be listed on regulated exchanges, also increasing liquidity and market cap.受监管的交易所。如果克服了技术上的挑战，门罗币可能会在受监管的交易所上市，同时增加流动性和市值。Economic empowerment and human rights. Monero’s privacy features and community ethos are aligned with human rights values and could become more widely recognized and used in countries that are experiencing political or economic oppression.经济赋权和人权。门罗币的隐私特征和社区精神与人权价值观相一致，可以在经受政治或经济压迫的国家得到更广泛的承认和使用。Private Wealth. Monero’s privacy features make it attractive to high-net-worth individuals and institutions that want to participate in the nascent cryptocurrency economy while keeping their finances private.私有财富。门罗币的隐私特性使其对高净值个人和机构具有吸引力，这些人希望参与新兴的加密货币经济，同时保持财务隐私。New developers. Being the number three cryptocurrency in terms of developers, Monero has an opportunity to attract new talent and surpass the amount of developers as Bitcoin or Ethereum, the only two current leaders over Monero by number of developers.新开发人员。作为开发者数量排名第三的加密货币，门罗币有机会吸引新的人才，并超过比特币(Bitcoin)或以太坊(Ethereum)这两种目前在开发者数量上领先于门罗币的货币。Open Source Community. The free and open source ethos of Monero are very strong, which make it a candidate to be adopted by the ever expanding global open source community. Continued adoption can lead to an even stronger ecosystem and increased liquidity.开源社区。门罗币的自由和开源精神非常强大，这使得它成为不断扩展的全球开源社区的备选项。继续采用门罗币可形成更强大的生态系统，并增加其流动性。Artists. Artists of various genres have begun to integrate Monero payments, a trend that may continue and thus, support the use case of Monero.艺术家。不同流派的艺术家已经开始整合门罗币支付，这一趋势可能会继续下去，从而支持门罗币的使用。Threats 风险Regulation. Monero faces a threat of being removed from exchanges in the future if regulation around exchanges continues. The privacy focus of Monero also makes it a potential target of KYC/AML regulation. Although the ability to share private view keys for auditing Monero will curb this threat substantially, it could create near-term challenges until regulators are educated.监管。如果围绕交易所的监管继续下去，门罗币未来将面临被逐出交易所的风险。门罗币对隐私的关注也使其成为客户身份验证/反洗钱监管的潜在目标。尽管门罗币共享审计的查阅私钥可以在很大程度上遏制这一风险，但在监管机构弄明白以前，这可能会在短期内带来挑战。Market share. Monero could lose market share to other privacy coins.市场份额。门罗币的市场份额可能会被其他隐私币夺走。Hidden inflation. While this risk has been asserted to be provably irrational many times by prominent and trusted community members and developers, it is still a theoretical risk.隐性通货膨胀。虽然卓越的、值得信任的社区成员和开发人员已经多次断言这个风险是不合理的，但它仍然是一个理论上的风险。Blockchain analysis. Various blockchain analysis risks exist, including timing attacks, poisoned outputs, clearnet usage (unobfuscated IP address), and honeypots. Fortunately the community of developers discuss these regularly and are actively working to address the risks. Monero’s workgroups also develop videos, articles, and best practice PSAs （PSA - Public Service Announcement）to help new users learn these threats and how to remain as safe as possible.  区块链分析。存在各种各样的区块链分析风险。幸运的是，开发人员社区会定期讨论这些问题，并积极地处理这些风险。门罗币的工作组还开发视频、文章和最佳实践公益宣传，以帮助新用户了解这些风险以及如何尽可能保持安全。Network Attacks. A variety of attacks on the Monero network are theoretically possible and have been explored in depth by the Breaking Monero series.网络攻击。对门罗币网络的各种攻击在理论上是可能的，并已经在攻击门罗币系列被深入探讨过。Misinformation and censorship. Coordinated misinformation campaigns could potentially lead to attempts to ban Monero in certain jurisdictions or decrease its popularity in general. While Monero cannot technically be censored, this theoretical threat could hurt its adoption and decrease liquidity in certain jurisdictions.错误信息和审查。协调错误信息事件可能导致在某些司法管辖区禁止门罗币或降低其总体受欢迎程度。虽然门罗币在技术上不可能受到审查，但这种理论上的风险可能会影响其在某些司法管辖区的采用，并降低流动性。
